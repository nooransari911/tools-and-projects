Don't get stuck in analysis paralysis, in life the speed of decisions is as important as the quality of your decisions. If you're \nunder the age of 24, losing 3-6 months to a skill that can has potential to make you 5-6L in the next one year is a better bet than a college project from a tier 3 project. \nOn learning:  Learning isn't always meant to be fun; it should feel like hard work. There are a lot of videos on YouTube etc. that give the appearance of education, but if you look closely they are \nreally just entertainment. This is very convenient for everyone involved: the people watching enjoy thinking they are learning (but actually they are just having fun). So make sure you're not just \npseudo learning the skill -- we only have 3-6 months! If you're an individual who is not self motivated join online communities where you can learn in a group or with a partner, there are enough \nand more discord communities of students upskilling and sharing progress with each other \nOn building portfolio & posting on social media: Don't wait for you to become the best in the field, start posting your work as soon as you have learnt the basics, this will show your progress on \nhow you went from point A to point B. This will also put social pressure and hold you accountable to keep getting better as you share your work with the world. Posting your work on social media \nalso increases chances of a recruiter stumbling upon your work and reaching out to you, it increases your surface area of luck. Create a kickass portfolio using canva/ framer/webflow/ or any no-\ncode website platforms that are easy to use. Show your work but also make your personality stand out -- here's a portfolio I received few years back that I really liked (https://aaryamanbasu.com/ \n-- please don't spam this person :P)\nOn  cold outreaches :  Remember the other person has no idea who you are, so worst thing that you'll get from the outreach is a no reply. Write the best email about yourself and how your skills \nhelp this other person's company's needs. USe Chat gpt or claude to give you ideas and improve your personal voice. \nOn networking:  Think of your network as leverage. Most hires in startups are made through connections, with people bringing in others they know. Companies even pay bonuses for good referrals. By \nbuilding a strong network within top startups, you make it easier for them to bring you on board. Leverage your network to get introductions, referrals, and insider info. This is not just about \nknowing people, but about being known by the right people. Your network can be the difference between struggling to find a job and having multiple offers on the table!\nOn AI:  Most people around you are still very slow to adopt AI, but if you can leverage these tools to improve workflows, the hard work you need to put in can be reduced by 50%. This makes you far \nmore valuable to any company, as you possess specific knowledge that others don’t. By using AI tools in your specific role, you can accomplish more work in less time. Don’t sleep on AI tools – if \nyou can pick them up right now, you’ll be far ahead of your peers and significantly more valuable to companies.\nSomething I read recently: \n")]
