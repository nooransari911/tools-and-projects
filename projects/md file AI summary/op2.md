## What is the default return type of main in c++?
 The default return type of the main function in C++ is int. This means that the main function is expected to return an integer value to the operating system when it completes execution. The return value of the main function is used to indicate the status of the program to the operating system. A return value of 0 usually indicates that the program executed successfully, while a non-zero return value indicates that an error occurred.


## What is achieved with cascading of i/p operators?
 Cascading of input operators allows for the chaining of multiple input operations on the same input stream. This means that multiple values can be read from the input stream and assigned to different variables in a single statement.

For example, the following code reads three values from the input stream and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`:

```c++
int a, b, c;
cin >> a >> b >> c;
```

This is equivalent to the following code:

```c++
int a;
cin >> a;
int b;
cin >> b;
int c;
cin >> c;
```

However, the cascading of input operators is more concise and easier to read.

Cascading of input operators can also be used with other input stream methods, such as `getline()` and `ignore()`. For example, the following code reads a line of text from the input stream and assigns it to the variable `line`:

```c++
string line;
getline(cin, line);
```

This is equivalent to the following code:

```c++
string line;
cin.getline(line);
```

However, the cascading of input operators is more concise and easier to read.


## What is the structure of the C++ program? Show with reference to
your assignments.
 **Structure of a C++ Program**

A C++ program typically consists of the following sections:

1. **Header Files:** These files contain declarations of functions, classes, and other entities that are used in the program. They are included using the `#include` directive.

2. **Namespace Declarations:** These declarations specify the namespaces that are used in the program. They are typically placed at the beginning of the program.

3. **Class Declarations:** These declarations define the classes that are used in the program. They typically contain member variables, member functions, and constructors.

4. **Function Declarations:** These declarations define the functions that are used in the program. They typically specify the function name, return type, and parameters.

5. **Main Function:** This is the entry point of the program. It is typically defined as `int main()`. The `main` function contains the code that is executed when the program is run.

6. **Comments:** These are used to provide additional information about the program. They are typically placed throughout the program to explain the code.

**Example:**

The following is an example of a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```c++
// Header file
#include <iostream>

// Namespace declaration
using namespace std;

// Main function
int main() {
  // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
  cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;

  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
  return 0;
}
```

This program consists of the following sections:

1. **Header File:** The program includes the `iostream` header file, which contains the declaration of the `cout` object.

2. **Namespace Declaration:** The program uses the `std` namespace, which contains the `cout` object.

3. **Main Function:** The program defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.

4. **Comments:** The program contains comments that explain the code.

## *What is the difference between a constructor and a destructor in C++?

**Answer:**

A constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class. It is used to initialize the data members of the class. A constructor has the same name as the class and does not have any return type.

On the other hand, a destructor is also a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of that class goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It is used to release the resources allocated by the constructor. A destructor has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~) and does not have any return type.

Here is a simple example to illustrate the difference between a constructor and a destructor:

```c++
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        // Constructor code
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        // Destructor code
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // Constructor is called here
    // ...
    return 0; // Destructor is called here
}
```

In this example, the constructor is called when the object `obj` is created, and the destructor is called when the object `obj` goes out of scope.

## What do you mean by tokens? Mention all of them. Show tokens from
any assignment you have completed
 **Tokens in C++**

Tokens are the basic building blocks of a C++ program. They are the smallest units that the compiler can recognize and process. Tokens can be classified into the following categories:

* **Keywords:** Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning to the compiler. They cannot be used as identifiers. Some examples of keywords are `int`, `float`, `if`, `else`, and `for`.
* **Identifiers:** Identifiers are names that are used to identify variables, functions, and other entities in a program. They must start with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. Some examples of identifiers are `x`, `y`, `sum`, and `average`.
* **Literals:** Literals are constant values that are represented directly in the source code. They can be of various types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and characters. Some examples of literals are `10`, `3.14`, `"Hello, world!"`, and `'a'`.
* **Operators:** Operators are symbols that represent operations that can be performed on operands. Some examples of operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
* **Punctuators:** Punctuators are symbols that are used to separate tokens and to group statements together. Some examples of punctuators are `()`, `{}`, `;`, and `,`.
* **Comments:** Comments are lines of text that are ignored by the compiler. They are used to provide documentation and explanations about the code. Comments start with `//` or `/*` and end with `\n` or `*/`.

Here are some tokens from an assignment I completed:

```c++
int main() {
  // This is a comment.
  int x = 10; // This is a variable declaration.
  float y = 3.14; // This is another variable declaration.
  if (x > y) { // This is an if statement.
    // This is the body of the if statement.
    cout << "x is greater than y." << endl; // This is a cout statement.
  } else { // This is the else statement.
    // This is the body of the else statement.
    cout << "y is greater than or equal to x." << endl; // This is another cout statement.
  }
  return 0; // This is the return statement.
}
```

The tokens in this assignment include the following:

* Keywords: `int`, `float`, `if`, `else`, `return`
* Identifiers: `main`, `x`, `y`
* Literals: `10`, `3.14`, `"x is greater than y."`, `"y is greater than or equal to x."`
* Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`
* Punctuators: `()`, `{}`, `;`, `,`
* Comments: `// This is a comment.`


## How many new keywords are added in C++ (48 old+15)?
 In C++ (48 old+15), a total of 63 new keywords have been added. These keywords are used to introduce new features and enhance the functionality of the language. Here are the 15 new keywords added in C++:

1. auto: This keyword is used for automatic type deduction of variables.

2. bool: This keyword is used to declare Boolean variables.

3. char16_t: This keyword is used to declare 16-bit Unicode characters.

4. char32_t: This keyword is used to declare 32-bit Unicode characters.

5. constexpr: This keyword is used to declare constant expressions.

6. decltype: This keyword is used to deduce the type of an expression.

7. explicit: This keyword is used to prevent implicit conversions.

8. inline: This keyword is used to suggest to the compiler that a function should be inlined.

9. mutable: This keyword is used to allow modification of a const member variable.

10. namespace: This keyword is used to declare a namespace.

11. noexcept: This keyword is used to indicate that a function will not throw an exception.

12. override: This keyword is used to override a virtual function in a derived class.

13. static_assert: This keyword is used to perform compile-time assertions.

14. thread_local: This keyword is used to declare thread-local variables.

15. using: This keyword is used to introduce a using declaration.

These new keywords, along with the existing 48 keywords, provide a comprehensive set of tools for C++ programmers to build powerful and efficient applications.

## What is the difference between a constructor and a destructor in C++?

**Answer:**

A constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class. It is used to initialize the data members of the class. A constructor has the same name as the class and does not have any return type.

On the other hand, a destructor is also a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of that class goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It is used to release the resources allocated by the constructor. A destructor has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~) and does not have any return type.

    MyClass() {
        // Constructor code
    }

    ~MyClass() {

    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // Constructor is called here
    // ...
    return 0; // Destructor is called here
}
```

In this example, the constructor is called when the object `obj` is created, and the destructor is called when the object `obj` goes out of scope.

## What are identifiers? Show identifiers from any assignment you have
completed.
 **What are identifiers?**

Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, classes, and other user-defined entities in a C++ program. They are used to refer to these entities in the program code.

Identifiers must follow certain rules:

* They must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
* They can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
* They cannot contain spaces or special characters (except for the underscore).
* They cannot be keywords in the C++ language.

**Identifiers from an assignment**

Here are some identifiers from an assignment I completed recently:

* `name`: A variable that stores the name of a person.
* `age`: A variable that stores the age of a person.
* `salary`: A variable that stores the salary of a person.
* `print_person()`: A function that prints the details of a person.
* `Person`: A class that represents a person.

These identifiers are used to refer to the corresponding entities in the program code. For example, the variable `name` is used to store the name of a person, and the function `print_person()` is used to print the details of a person.

## What are basic data types, new data types introduced and user
defined data types in C++?Draw hierarchy.
 **Basic Data Types in C++**

* **Integer types:** `int`, `short`, `long`, `long long`
* **Floating-point types:** `float`, `double`, `long double`
* **Character types:** `char`, `wchar_t`
* **Boolean type:** `bool`

**New Data Types Introduced in C++**

* **Complex numbers:** `complex<T>`
* **Reference types:** `T&`
* **Pointer types:** `T*`
* **Function pointers:** `T (*)(args)`
* **Arrays:** `T[size]`
* **Structures:** `struct { ... }`
* **Classes:** `class { ... }`
* **Unions:** `union { ... }`
* **Enumerations:** `enum { ... }`

**User-Defined Data Types in C++**

User-defined data types are created by the programmer using the `struct`, `class`, or `union` keywords. These data types can be used to represent complex data structures that are not built into the C++ language.

**Hierarchy of Data Types in C++**

The following diagram shows the hierarchy of data types in C++:

## What is the need of reference variable (alias)? Write down a syntax
of it.
 **Need of Reference Variable (Alias):**

A reference variable, also known as an alias, provides an alternative name for an existing variable. It allows you to access and manipulate the same underlying data without creating a copy of the original variable. This can be useful in various scenarios:

1. **Efficiency:** Passing large objects by reference instead of copying them can significantly improve performance, especially when working with complex data structures or large arrays.

2. **Aliasing:** Reference variables can be used to create multiple names for the same variable, making it easier to work with complex data structures or when multiple parts of your code need to access the same data.

3. **Function Arguments:** Reference parameters in functions allow you to modify the original variable passed as an argument, rather than creating a local copy. This can be useful when you want to make changes to the original variable within the function.

**Syntax of Reference Variable:**

The syntax for declaring a reference variable in C++ is:

```c++
type& reference_name = original_variable;
```

Here, `type` is the data type of the reference variable, `reference_name` is the name of the reference variable, and `original_variable` is the name of the original variable being referenced.

For example:

```c++
int x = 10;
int& y = x; // y is a reference to x

y = 20; // Modifying y changes the value of x
cout << x << endl; // Output: 20
```

In this example, `y` is a reference to the variable `x`. Any changes made to `y` will directly affect the value of `x`.


## None
## Mention all new operators introduced in c++.
 **New Operators in C++**

C++ introduces several new operators to support object-oriented programming. These operators are:

* **new**: The `new` operator is used to allocate memory for a new object. It takes the type of the object as its argument and returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory.
* **delete**: The `delete` operator is used to deallocate memory that was allocated with the `new` operator. It takes a pointer to the object as its argument and frees the memory that was allocated for the object.
* **this**: The `this` pointer is a special pointer that refers to the current object. It can be used to access the members of the current object.
* **.*` (dot operator): The dot operator is used to access the members of an object. It takes the object as its left operand and the member name as its right operand.
* **->` (arrow operator): The arrow operator is used to access the members of a pointer to an object. It takes the pointer to the object as its left operand and the member name as its right operand.
* **::` (scope resolution operator): The scope resolution operator is used to access the members of a class. It takes the class name as its left operand and the member name as its right operand.

These operators are essential for object-oriented programming in C++. They allow you to create and destroy objects, access the members of objects, and call methods on objects.


## None
## How an object is created dynamically? (which operator is used)
 An object can be created dynamically in C++ using the `new` operator. The `new` operator allocates memory on the heap and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. The following code shows how to create an object dynamically:

```c++
// Create an object dynamically
MyClass *object = new MyClass();

// Use the object
object->doSomething();

// Delete the object when finished
delete object;
```

The `new` operator can also be used to create an array of objects. The following code shows how to create an array of 10 objects:

```c++
// Create an array of objects dynamically
MyClass *objects = new MyClass[10];

// Use the objects
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  objects[i].doSomething();
}

// Delete the objects when finished
delete[] objects;
```

When you create an object dynamically, you are responsible for deleting the object when you are finished with it. If you do not delete the object, it will remain in memory and will eventually cause a memory leak.


## None
## Show how type casting is done with example.
 **Type casting** is the process of converting a value of one data type to another. In C++, there are two types of type casting:

* **Implicit type casting** is performed automatically by the compiler. For example, if you assign a value of type `int` to a variable of type `double`, the compiler will automatically convert the `int` value to a `double` value.
* **Explicit type casting** is performed manually by the programmer. To explicitly type cast a value, you use the `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, or `reinterpret_cast` operator.

Here is an example of how to use explicit type casting:

```c++
int main() {
  // Create an int variable and assign it a value.
  int x = 10;

  // Create a double variable and assign it the value of x.
  double y = static_cast<double>(x);

  // Print the value of y.
  cout << y << endl; // Output: 10.0

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `static_cast` operator is used to explicitly convert the value of `x` from an `int` to a `double`. The `dynamic_cast` operator can be used to convert a pointer or reference to a base class to a pointer or reference to a derived class. The `reinterpret_cast` operator can be used to convert a pointer or reference to one type to a pointer or reference to another type.

Type casting can be a useful tool for converting data between different types. However, it is important to use type casting carefully, as it can lead to errors if it is not used correctly.

## What is waterfall model? What is implicit (automatic)
conversion.
 **Waterfall Model**

The waterfall model is a sequential development process that follows a linear progression from one phase to the next. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin. The waterfall model is often used in software development, but it can also be used in other industries.

The waterfall model consists of the following phases:

1. **Requirements gathering and analysis:** This phase involves gathering and understanding the requirements of the project.
2. **Design:** This phase involves creating a detailed design of the system.
3. **Implementation:** This phase involves coding the system according to the design.
4. **Testing:** This phase involves testing the system to ensure that it meets the requirements.
5. **Deployment:** This phase involves installing the system in the production environment.
6. **Maintenance:** This phase involves maintaining the system and fixing any bugs that are found.

**Implicit (Automatic) Conversion**

Implicit conversion, also known as automatic conversion, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another without explicitly specifying the conversion. Implicit conversion is performed by the compiler when it encounters a situation where a value of one data type is expected, but a value of another data type is provided.

For example, if you have a variable of type `int` and you assign a value of type `float` to it, the compiler will automatically convert the `float` value to an `int` value. This is because `int` is a smaller data type than `float`, so the compiler can safely truncate the `float` value to an `int` value.

Implicit conversion can also be used to convert between different types of objects. For example, if you have a class called `Person` and you have a variable of type `Object` that contains a reference to a `Person` object, the compiler will automatically convert the `Object` reference to a `Person` reference. This is because the `Person` class is a subclass of the `Object` class, so the compiler can safely cast the `Object` reference to a `Person` reference.

Implicit conversion can be a convenient way to convert values between different data types, but it can also be a source of errors. If you are not careful, you can accidentally convert a value to the wrong data type, which can lead to unexpected results.

## Mention and show (in assignments) three/two parts of functions
.
 **Parts of a function in C++ OOP:**

1. **Function declaration:** This is the first part of a function, and it specifies the function's name, return type, and parameters.

```c++
// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);
```

2. **Function definition:** This is the second part of a function, and it contains the implementation of the function.

```c++
// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

3. **Function call:** This is the third part of a function, and it is used to invoke the function and execute its code.

```c++
// Function call
int result = add(10, 20);
```

**Assignments:**

1. **Function declaration:**

```c++
int add(int a, int b);
```

2. **Function definition:**

```c++
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

3. **Function call:**

## Compare inline functions and macros.
 **Inline Functions vs Macros**

**Inline Functions**

* Inline functions are functions that are expanded inline at the point of call.
* They are declared with the `inline` keyword.
* Inline functions can be used to improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls.
* However, inline functions can also increase the size of the executable code.

**Macros**

* Macros are preprocessor directives that are replaced with their values before the compilation process.
* They are declared with the `#define` directive.
* Macros can be used to define constants, function-like macros, and other preprocessor directives.
* Macros can be used to improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls.
* However, macros can also make the code difficult to read and maintain.

**Comparison**

| Feature | Inline Functions | Macros |
|---|---|---|
| Syntax | `inline` keyword | `#define` directive |
| Expansion | Expanded inline at the point of call | Replaced with their values before compilation |
| Performance | Can improve performance by reducing function call overhead | Can improve performance by reducing function call overhead |
| Code size | Can increase the size of the executable code | Can make the code difficult to read and maintain |
| Readability | Easy to read and maintain | Can make the code difficult to read and maintain |

**Conclusion**

Inline functions and macros are both powerful tools that can be used to improve the performance of C++ programs. However, it is important to use them judiciously, as they can also have negative consequences.
