#### Access Management: Authentication and Authorization

Access management is crucial for controlling who can access your data and resources and what actions they are permitted to perform. This involves two key components:

* **Authentication:**  Authentication verifies the identity of the user or system attempting to access a resource. It uses credentials to establish trust. AWS IAM plays a critical role in managing identities and controlling authentication. 
* **Authorization:** Authorization determines which actions a user or system is allowed to perform after successful authentication. IAM policies and permissions govern these actions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

#### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

AWS IAM is a fundamental service for securely managing access to your AWS resources. It provides granular control over who can access specific services and resources within your account.

Here are key features of IAM:
