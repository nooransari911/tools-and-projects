Let's break down the code step-by-step and explain the logic behind each part:

**1. Imports:**

```python
import os
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.cloud import storage
```

- `os`: Used for interacting with the operating system, like creating directories (`os.makedirs`).
- `subprocess`:  Allows running shell commands (like Git commands) within Python.
- `datetime`: Used for handling dates and times.
- `timedelta`: Used for calculating time differences (e.g., days between backups).
- `google.cloud.bigquery`: Provides the BigQuery client library.
- `google.cloud.storage`: Provides the Cloud Storage client library.

**2. `backup_github_repos` Function:**

```python
def backup_github_repos(request):
    # ...
```

- This function is the core of your Cloud Function. It handles the backup logic for all your GitHub repositories.

**3. Environment Variables:**

```python
    # Get environment variables
    github_username = os.environ['GITHUB_USERNAME']
    github_token = os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN']
    bucket_name = os.environ['BACKUP_BUCKET']
    bigquery_project = os.environ['BIGQUERY_PROJECT']
    bigquery_dataset = os.environ['BIGQUERY_DATASET']
    bigquery_table = os.environ['BIGQUERY_TABLE']
```

- **`GITHUB_USERNAME`:** Your GitHub username.
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`:** Your GitHub personal access token (with "repo" scope).
- **`BACKUP_BUCKET`:** The name of your Cloud Storage bucket where backups will be stored.
- **`BIGQUERY_PROJECT`:** The ID of your BigQuery project.
- **`BIGQUERY_DATASET`:** The name of the BigQuery dataset where your backup information will be stored.
- **`BIGQUERY_TABLE`:** The name of the BigQuery table where backup information will be stored.

   - **Important:** These variables must be set in your Cloud Function's environment. You'll need to configure them in the Cloud Function's settings in the Google Cloud Console.

**4. BigQuery Client:**

```python
    # Create BigQuery client
    bigquery_client = bigquery.Client()
    table_ref = bigquery_client.dataset(bigquery_dataset).table(bigquery_table)
```

- Creates a BigQuery client object to interact with your BigQuery project.
- Gets a reference to the table where backup information will be stored.

**5. Cloud Storage Client:**

```python
    # Create Cloud Storage client
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
```

- Creates a Cloud Storage client object to interact with your Cloud Storage bucket.
- Gets a reference to your Cloud Storage bucket.

**6. Get Repositories (Example):**

```python
    # Get list of repositories
    # (You could fetch repos from the GitHub API, but using env variables is simpler for this example)
    repos = [
        {'name': 'your-repo-name', 'clone_url': 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git'},
        # ... Add other repositories here ...
    ]
```

- For this example, the repositories are hardcoded into the code for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you'd typically fetch the list of repositories dynamically from the GitHub API.

**7. Loop Through Repositories:**

```python
    for repo in repos:
        repo_name = repo['name']
        clone_url = repo['clone_url']
        # ...
```

- Iterates through each repository in the list.
- Extracts the repository name and its clone URL.

**8. Check Existing Backup Information:**

```python
        # Check BigQuery for existing backup information
        query = f"""
            SELECT last_commit_sha, last_backup_timestamp
            FROM `{bigquery_project}.{bigquery_dataset}.{bigquery_table}`
            WHERE repo_name = '{repo_name}'
        """
        query_job = bigquery_client.query(query)
        results = query_job.result()

        last_commit_sha = None
        last_backup_timestamp = None
        for row in results:
            last_commit_sha = row.last_commit_sha
            last_backup_timestamp = row.last_backup_timestamp
```

- Constructs a SQL query to check if a backup record exists in BigQuery for the current repository.
- Executes the query using `bigquery_client.query()`.
- Retrieves the last commit SHA and backup timestamp from the BigQuery results.

**9. Determine Backup Type:**

```python
        # Determine if a full or incremental backup is needed
        if last_commit_sha is None or (current_backup_time - last_backup_timestamp) > timedelta(days=7):
            print(f"Performing full backup for {repo_name}")
            # ... (Full backup logic) ...
        else:
            print(f"Performing incremental backup for {repo_name}")
            # ... (Incremental backup logic) ...
```

- **Full Backup:**  If there's no existing backup record in BigQuery, or the last backup was more than 7 days ago, a full backup is performed.
- **Incremental Backup:** Otherwise, an incremental backup is performed, meaning only the changes since the last backup are captured.

**10. Backup Logic:**

**Full Backup (`git clone --mirror`):**

```python
            # Full backup using `git clone --mirror`
            backup_dir = f'/tmp/{repo_name}'  # Temporary directory in Cloud Function
            os.makedirs(backup_dir, exist_ok=True)
            subprocess.run(
                ['git', 'clone', '--mirror', clone_url, backup_dir],
                cwd='/tmp',
                check=True,
            )

            # Get latest commit SHA from the cloned repository
            latest_commit_sha = subprocess.check_output(
                ['git', 'rev-parse', 'HEAD'],
                cwd=backup_dir,
            ).decode('utf-8').strip()

            # Upload to Cloud Storage
            blob = bucket.blob(f'{github_username}/{repo_name}.git')
            blob.upload_from_directory(backup_dir)

            # Update BigQuery with the latest commit SHA and backup timestamp
            row_to_insert = {
                'repo_name': repo_name,
                'last_commit_sha': latest_commit_sha,
                'last_backup_timestamp': current_backup_time
            }
            bigquery_client.insert_rows_json(table_ref, [row_to_insert])
```

- **Create Temporary Directory:** Creates a temporary directory within the Cloud Function's temporary storage (`/tmp`) to store the cloned repository.
- **`git clone --mirror`:**  Uses the `git clone --mirror` command to create a bare repository (only the Git data, not the actual files). This is efficient for storing only the changes.
- **Get Latest Commit SHA:**  Executes `git rev-parse HEAD` to get the latest commit SHA from the cloned repository.
- **Upload to Cloud Storage:** Uploads the cloned repository (in the temporary directory) to Cloud Storage as a `.git` directory.
- **Update BigQuery:** Inserts a new row into the BigQuery table with the repository name, latest commit SHA, and the current backup timestamp.

**Incremental Backup (`git remote update`):**

```python
            # Incremental backup using `git remote update`
            backup_dir = f'/tmp/{repo_name}'
            os.makedirs(backup_dir, exist_ok=True)

            # Clone the repository if it doesn't exist locally
            if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(backup_dir, '.git')):
                subprocess.run(
                    ['git', 'clone', '--mirror', clone_url, backup_dir],
                    cwd='/tmp',
                    check=True,
                )

            # Update the remote repository
            subprocess.run(
                ['git', 'remote', 'update'],
                cwd=backup_dir,
                check=True,
            )

            # Get latest commit SHA from the cloned repository
            latest_commit_sha = subprocess.check_output(
                ['git', 'rev-parse', 'HEAD'],
                cwd=backup_dir,
            ).decode('utf-8').strip()

            # Update BigQuery with the latest commit SHA and backup timestamp
            row_to_insert = {
                'repo_name': repo_name,
                'last_commit_sha': latest_commit_sha,
                'last_backup_timestamp': current_backup_time
            }
            bigquery_client.insert_rows_json(table_ref, [row_to_insert])
```

- **Create Temporary Directory:** Creates a temporary directory for the cloned repository.
- **Clone (If Necessary):** If the repository doesn't exist locally, it clones it using `git clone --mirror`.
- **`git remote update`:**  Executes `git remote update` to fetch any changes from the remote repository since the last backup.
- **Get Latest Commit SHA:**  Gets the latest commit SHA from the updated repository.
- **Update BigQuery:**  Inserts a new row into the BigQuery table with the updated commit SHA and timestamp.

**11. Return Success Message:**

```python
    return 'Repositories backed up successfully!'
```

- Returns a simple success message after all repositories have been processed.

**Important Points:**

- **Error Handling:**  It's crucial to add `try-except` blocks around the Git commands, BigQuery operations, and Cloud Storage operations to handle potential errors gracefully.
- **Authentication:** Ensure your GitHub personal access token is securely stored as an environment variable and has the necessary permissions to access your repositories.
- **Monitoring:**  Set up monitoring alerts (using Cloud Monitoring) to track the backup process and get notified of any failures.
- **Deployment and Scheduling:** Deploy this code as a Cloud Function and use Cloud Scheduler to schedule regular executions.
