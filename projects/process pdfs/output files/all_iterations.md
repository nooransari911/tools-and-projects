ETL and ELT Comparison\n\nThis section explores the core processes used to ingest data into an analytics pipeline, comparing the traditional ETL approach with the more modern ELT approach.\n\n#### 1.2.1 Ingesting Data: Storing and Processing\n\nData ingestion involves bringing data from external sources into your pipeline for analysis and processing. This process is intricately linked to storing and processing data, forming a crucial part of the data pipeline.\n\nThe ingestion process typically involves the following steps:\n\n* **Extraction:** Gathering data from an external source outside your pipeline.\n* **Loading:** Placing the extracted data into temporary storage within the pipeline.\n* **Processing:** Transforming the data before or after loading it into permanent storage.\n\nThe extent and nature of transformations, as well as their placement within the pipeline, are heavily influenced by business needs and the type of data being ingested.\n\n#### 1.2.2 ETL and ELT\n\n##### 1.2.2.1 Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)\n\nThe ETL approach, a traditional method, involves:\n\n1. **Extraction:** Extracting structured data from its source.\n2. **Transformation:** Transforming the data to match the desired format for analytics applications.\n3. **Loading:** Loading the transformed data into structured storage, often a data warehouse.\n\n##### 1.2.2.2 Extract, Load, Transform (ELT)\n\nELT, a newer approach, emerged with the rise of data lakes to handle vast amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data. ELT involves:\n\n1. **Extraction:** Extracting unstructured or structured data.\n2. **Loading:** Loading the data into the data lake, retaining as much of its raw form as possible.\n3. **Transformation:** Transforming the data as needed for specific analytics scenarios, often performed later when accessing the data for specific use cases.\n\n#### 1.2.3 Benefits of ETL\n\n* **Automated routine transformations:** ETL simplifies analysis by storing data that is already prepared for use.\n* **Filtering sensitive data:** Performing transformations upfront allows you to remove personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data, mitigating compliance risks.\n\nETL is particularly suitable for structured data destined for a data warehouse. Pre-processing transformations optimize analysis time and minimize security concerns.\n\n#### 1.2.4 Benefits of ELT\n\n* **Faster ingestion:** ELT can accelerate the ingestion process by postponing transformations until a later stage.\n* **Greater flexibility:** ELT provides more flexibility for creating new queries by offering access to raw data, allowing for greater exploration.\n\nELT is well-suited for unstructured data destined for a data lake. It delivers faster ingestion and enhances flexibility for data exploration.\n\n#### 1.2.5 The Evolving Ingestion Process\n\nThe ingestion process is dynamic, evolving based on the needs of both pipeline builders and users.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* A data engineer automates a nightly batch process to ingest support ticket data.\n* A data scientist requests that comment fields are no longer truncated, as they are needed for sentiment analysis.\n* Data analysts routinely apply a common date format transformation and request its inclusion in the ingestion process.\n\nModern data architectures often blur the lines between ETL and ELT, with different roles using various tools to perform different parts of the ingestion and transformation process.\n\n**For example:**\n\n* Data engineers might use ingestion tools to handle common transformations before loading data into a data lake.\n* Data analysts might apply transformations on ingested data to prepare it for specific reports.\n* Data scientists might perform additional discovery and transformation to investigate hypotheses about data relationships.\n\nThe ingestion process requires continuous monitoring and adjustment based on usage patterns and evolving needs. This includes:\n\n* **Optimizing performance:** Including recurring transformations in pre-loading processing can improve performance and reduce costs.\n* **Addressing new needs:** Reducing the amount of pre-loading transformations might be necessary to accommodate new requirements.\n\nAs a data engineer, it\'s crucial to monitor pipeline performance, access patterns, and usage to maximize its value and adapt to changing demands.\n\n#### 1.2.6 Key Takeaways: ETL and ELT Comparison\n\n* Ingestion involves pulling data into the pipeline and applying transformations.\n* ETL is suitable for structured data destined for a data warehouse.\n* ELT is suitable for unstructured data destined for a data lake.\n* The ETL and ELT processing should evolve to optimize pipeline value and adapt to evolving needs.\n\n### 1.3. Data Wrangling: An Overview\n\nThis section delves into the high-level processes involved in preparing data for ingestion into an analytics pipeline, highlighting the crucial role of data wrangling.\n\n#### 1.3.1 Data Wrangling\n\nData wrangling is the complex process of transforming large amounts of unstructured or structured raw data from multiple sources, each with its own schema, into a meaningful and valuable dataset for downstream processes or users.\n\nWhile data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts might all engage in data wrangling, their individual roles and activities within this process vary based on their needs and the initial state of the data.\n\n#### 1.3.2 Data Wrangling Addresses Data Variety\n\nData wrangling is essential for managing data variety, as exemplified by the following scenario:\n\n**Example:**\n\n* A company queries its on-premises database to identify patients overdue for visits.\n* Public health data is combined with customer data to identify demographic risk factors for heart attacks, allowing for personalized information for patients with those risks.\n* Real-time heart monitoring data from a mobile app is analyzed for anomalies, potentially alerting patients or their doctors.\n\nData engineers must bring together all this diverse data and make it accessible within the pipeline, empowering data scientists to build machine learning (ML) models for personalized predictions.\n\n#### 1.3.3 Data Wrangling Steps\n\nThe data wrangling process often aligns with ETL processing, but there are distinctions:\n\n* **Traditional ETL:** Data engineers focused on scripting and automating transformations with batch jobs, while analysts and data scientists worked with refined data.\n* **Data Wrangling:** More associated with an ELT flow, allowing business users or data scientists to directly transform datasets within the pipeline storage layer before refinement for specific use cases.\n\nCloud tools and services are increasingly abstracting infrastructure and coding tasks, granting more users direct access to data extraction and transformation. While data engineers remain crucial for building complete analytics pipelines and transforming data, they must stay informed about tools that empower analysts and data scientists with greater autonomy.\n\n#### 1.3.4 Example: ELT and Data Wrangling in a Modern Data Architecture\n\nThis section illustrates how data wrangling steps can be integrated into a modern data architecture using an ELT flow.\n\n**Example Architecture:**\n\n* Data is ingested into a storage layer containing an Amazon S3 data lake and an Amazon Redshift data warehouse.\n* S3 buckets are used as zones within the data lake, storing data in different states:\n    * **Landing zone:** Temporary storage for initial cleaning and validation.\n    * **Raw zone:** Permanent storage for ingested data in its relatively raw state.\n    * **Trusted zone:** Data structured for use in the data warehouse.\n    * **Curated layer:** Data enriched and validated for low-latency access and complex querying in Amazon Redshift.\n\n**Wrangling Steps in the Example Architecture:**\n\n* **Landing zone:** Data is cleaned and validated before being stored in the raw zone.\n* **Raw zone:** Data in the raw zone can be used for additional use cases.\n* **Trusted zone:** Data is structured, enriched, and validated before being stored in the curated layer.\n* **Curated layer:** Datasets are ready for ingestion into the Amazon Redshift data warehouse.\n\n**Comparison to ETL:**\n\n* The same wrangling tasks would still be necessary in a traditional ETL flow.\n* In ETL, all transformations would be performed on the data in a temporary staging location before loading it directly into the data warehouse.\n* Raw data would not be available to users until processing is complete.\n\n#### 1.3.5 Key Takeaways: Data Wrangling Introduction\n\n* Data wrangling is a multi-step process for transforming large amounts of data from multiple sources for analytics.\n* Data wrangling is crucial for data scientists building ML models.\n* Data wrangling steps might overlap, iterate, or not occur in some ingestion processes.\n* Data wrangling steps include discovery, structuring, cleaning, enriching, validating, and publishing.\n\n### 1.4.
